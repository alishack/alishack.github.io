We are settling down!
It's been a month since we moved into the new house and I'm finally getting to document here and share with friends and family.
After 2.5 wks of staying in hotel and vigorous rental searching, we finally moved in.

A day before Uboxes from Eugene arrives. I was exhausted. We moved in before our goods arrived. Just couldn't handle hotel any longer.

We had a dining table brought from Texas which was just sitting in the garage for 4yrs. I wanted to sell it and not bring it cross-country because I was heavy, but Mike wanted to keep it.
Boy ain't I glad that we kept it.. Furniture is expensive. You forget about how much decent furniture cost when you're living in small rental space.
