Today is my birthday and it was pretty memorable for a couple reasons.

1. It has been 11 years since my mom celebrated my birthday with me
2. I was afraid that baby would come out around my birthday
3. We are new to this town and know very few people
4. I woke up to a big birthday meal!

We went to mass and then explored willie street by checking out bakeries and plant stores. I've got a new pot for the little cactus friend who traveled from Eugene with us

And today being my birthday, I had to eat dukbokki.

I love you dukbokki

Being with people I love is the biggest gift that I can have, and I'm very grateful to have these people in my life
