What I think about the healthcare

What do I think about the healthcare in United States, or what do I think about the well-being of American.

On a policy level, we need a single healthcare insurance, preferably government operated, such as national health insurance while having smaller private insurances. A single source managed healthcare will give more coverage and care to entire citizen. Your neighbor's health matters to you, at least  financially. Neighbor, I meant, doesn't just refer to the ones live next you, but also include those who live on the street.


Mental health and preventative medicine have to be promoted to reduce the cost to the state and the individual. For an individual, unrecognized importance of self-care early on pays high negative dividends. No medicine, pills, or surgery can dampen the pain, heartbreak and uncertainty that are brought by deteriorated health to one's family. 

Healthy body is the one that circulates well, intake energy well and remove toxins well. There are many ways to aid those functions, by adding an additional measure, or remove barriers to the functions. You need to move physically and think to use your mind. That can be incorporated into your routine by choosing a job or an activity you do the most of time regularly that makes you move and use your body and mind. If you think in an adding direct actions_not really the best solution_, you might think to add more exercise in the gym, and play a crossword puzzle etc. 

Secondly, take in clean energy that burns well and doesn't leave residues much. Body needs many different kinds of energy sources. If any of major sources lacks for a long time, there you will have a so and so deficiency. Ah, eating healthy, can this life go on without taking a nagging roar in our head. We know it's necessary, but how? What is healthy food? It can easily be mislead. Healthy food,  or better food is the one with the most energy. Sometimes fresh and sometimes cooked, depends on what stages of our body is, what food we are eating with.  When the food is processed many layers, through different steps of refining, or through traveling, it becomes a burden in digesting it with little purpose of taking it. It doesn't bring any usable energy, because calorie of the food it has can not be easily made into usable energy. It occupies the space in the stomach but not energy, you feel hungry even when your stomach is full. It then becomes toxin to your body when not timely digested. Our goal is not eating healthy a food. Our goal is to have a tongue that appreciates the fresh taste of food. Our goal is not ab out having a mindset that moves healthy food into your mouth, but our goal is to create a judge that can tell you which food you need to eat. It takes 21 days to clear and have a brand new tongue (thus all these rampant 21 day diet plans). Fake till make it. Try limiting eating processed food, which include processed meat, refined carbs, refined sugar, refined oil, fried anything and eating more fresh food, less processed food like whole veg, fruit, grain, fresh cut meat and fish. For 21 days, mostly. Your taste bud will bounce back and you can see what food can do.

Once you start eating healthy and have a lean body that moves well, removes toxin well, you will notice any undesirable factors that are in contact with your body and be able to judge well. Important factor for a healthy mind is to have a voice and to help others in need. It gives a tremendous gratitude to your being. Never forget that we are made of atom and will go back to the free range atom one day.  We are all made of a same thing. You, your dog, your desk, mushroom and the air.
