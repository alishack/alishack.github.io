# How we are getting ready for the new life

We are getting ready for the new life to come (it already came) and here's the new habit we're trying to adopt.
I am emotionally stable, not too different from before and after the oneset(commencement) of the pregnancy.
(except for the peak of the all-day-sickness days. For those days my emotional state was rather...not much happening, because my brain and body couldn't take any external anything: food, words, video, music and even air)

Think positively
I want to see the world with the loving window
Eat healthy
and most importantly, speak up. Speak up more.

We are both professional, we know how to advocate for the bigger public or ideology.
What has been lacking is speaking up for our personal choices and life.
Now that we want to raise other human being from the scratch, it's mandatory to set boundaries in personal level.
As much as I want the kid to explore things freely and learn freely, there are things that we need to communicate firmly to the child. 

First practice is to say 'no' to negative things. The child doesn't need to know 'situational lack of love' exist. Because it doesn't. he child should learn the love is everywhere because he/she is full of love. I want the kid to be the happiest person on earth not because he/she is the richest, the most powerful, or the most good looking, but because he/she is full of love and passion.

For this, I will fight whoever instill their 'lack of love' to our lives and they don't belong to our lives.
